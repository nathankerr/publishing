Working on latex (article):

- Paragraphs (body text) [done]
- Headings
	- all headings are numbered
	- section (two lines, normal)
	- subsection (one line, bold)
	- subsubsection (one line, normal)
	- paragraph (inline, bold)
	- subparagraph (inline, normal)
	- heading 6 does not render as a latex heading
	- chapter heading can be used with --chapters, modification of title for use (like before)
